# On the nature of mixed-type features in materials datasets
- This work is supported by the ESICMM Grant Number 12016013 (MEXT), JSPS KAKENHI Grants Number 20K05301 and Number JP19H05815 (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas \Interface Ionics").
- It proposes a predictive model to predict the target physical properties of materials with an emphasis on the nature of mixed-type features in materials datasets.
- The source code is implemented in Python 3.6.
- All datasets, results and source code are shared here.
